            "textHtml": "<div><div>So one thing that I&#39;m um particularly not good at is um is being efficient with content creation as it relates to any type of posting on social media. What I have a tendency to do is overanalyze the message. I spend too much time, creating the content, editing, the content, refining the content, and then sometimes I just don&#39;t even post it. I&#39;d say the majority of the time I don&#39;t even post it. So what I wanted to figure out is a a way to streamline that that content creation process. So to solve this problem, which, for me, I would spend if I was posting every single day, I would spend a couple hours every single day on just creating posts like this. So, what I wanted to do is figure out a workflow or create a workflow that would allow me to minimize my time spent on on creating these types of these types of these types of post specifically on LinkedIn. So what this workflow is, is it&#39;s a workflow where I can kind of change a or add a habit to to my daily life that is whether I&#39;m going on a walk or on a drive or whatever, I can use the voice recorder on my iPhone and just kind of dictate to the voice recorder. I have no shortage of ideas or things to speak about, especially if I&#39;m just prompted. So I can integrate that into my daily daily kind of workflow so I can add that as a kind of multitasking step. And basically, after I create the recording in its raw format, I can copy the transcription of the recording because iPhone now, the voice recorder handles that for you. I copy the transcription and then I email it to an email that I set up here that kicks off a a workflow that I built here in in in, so I&#39;ll take you through the workflow. So what happens is an email is received. When I email this specific email, and I&#39;m the only one that can it filters for my my sending email. So if my email is the one that sends, then it will kick off this, this workflow. So the first thing that we want to do is clean up and define the fields because there&#39;s a whole bunch of other J-son that gets attached to the email. So we just want to pull out the body of the email and other data. And then the other important piece is, I want to be able to clean and standardize, really for brandanding purposes. and to make sure I&#39;m on message. I want a standardize my post format and kind of my messaging structure. So what I&#39;ve created is a Google Doc that Google Doc has other posts or other yeah, other posts and it&#39;s kind of a running list of other posts from other content creators, people that I follow, people that I admire, and it has posts that I&#39;ve copied and pasted into that Google doc. So this Google Doc can be dynamic. What I mean by that is, is that, you know, as I&#39;m scrolling through LinkedIn, I can save a post to my LinkedIn, or I can copy and paste that content into the Google doc just as I&#39;m scrolling through. rotting my brain on LinkedIn. So what&#39;s happening here is we&#39;re taking and using this template that I have or using this Google doc as our inspiration to help us structure and clean up that free-flowing thought. So as you guessed, we can take this the transcript in this raw form, combine that with the structured inspiration document that saved in Google Dos and then run it through a large language model. In this case, we&#39;re using anropic and what the output is, is a a polished coherent, hopefully. post that outputs two different types of content. For me, I wanted to have the actual written content, so it&#39;s the written content that you typically see in a post, and then also an image description. I wanted to create an image description just so that way I can take that and maybe use use some sort of service like fiver or design something or use an AI tool to design the actual accompanying image, really just for idea purposes. So where all this is getting dumped right now is I have it being uploaded into an air table, so that way my team can approve any of those messages or request edits or whatever. I also get an email so I can see that in real time. So, yeah, this has been an incredible time saver. for us and this is a really simple, this is a really simple AI workflow that allows you to take your really just change one core behavior and just email yourself and you create content. And that&#39;s kind of all you need and everything gets stored an air table so you can schedule out a content calendar and be more diligent with your posting. So yeah, I would estimate that this saves me if I was posting one thing every day. It saves me at least an hour, maybe even two hours, every single day and just content creation. So that&#39;s a huge ROI for something so simple. So if you&#39;re interested in replicating this, please feel free to take a screenshot or I&#39;ll share a link to the downloadable JS so you can just upload it straight away and implement it in your business.
