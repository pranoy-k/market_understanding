It suits users who need a fast, structured starting point for web design while ensuring competitive relevance.\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case\n\nDesigning a high-converting landing page from scratch can be time-consuming. This workflow automates the process of analyzing a competitor’s website, identifying essential sections, and producing a tailored layout—helping users save time and improve their website’s effectiveness.\n\n### What this workflow does\n\nThe workflow fetches and analyzes your chosen competitor’s landing page, using web scraping and structure-detection nodes in n8n. It identifies primary sections like hero banners, service highlights, testimonials, and contact forms, and then generates a simplified, customizable layout suitable for wireframing or initial design.\n\n### Setup\n\n- Prepare your unique services and target audience profile for customization later.\n- Gather the competitor’s landing page URL you wish to analyze.\n- Run the workflow, inputting your competitor’s URL when prompted.\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- After generating the initial layout, adapt section names and content blocks to highlight your services and brand messaging.\n- Add or remove sections based on your objectives and audience insights.\n- Integrate additional nodes for richer analysis, such as keyword extraction or design pattern detection, to tailor the output further.\n"
