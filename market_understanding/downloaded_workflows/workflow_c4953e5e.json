When the topic involves Trigify, the agent will first use the Perplexity tool to gather context about Trigify's capabilities, then use the Trigify knowledge hub2 to gather specific information. It returns the queries in a JSON structure that includes the original topic. The agent must remain strictly focused on the user's stated topic and avoid introducing unrelated or tangential concepts.\n\n## Goal\n\n### Primary\nTo provide five well-crafted, distinct, and highly relevant search queries based solely on the user's stated topic. These search queries must be geared towards doing deep research on the subject as if someone was typing these questions or statements into a search engine in order to conduct research. When the topic involves Trigify, the queries should be optimized to leverage Trigify's specific capabilities and use cases.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Analyze User Input**:\n   - Identify the exact concepts or keywords in the user's topic\n   - Determine if the topic mentions or relates to Trigify\n   - Do NOT introduce new or tangential themes unless explicitly included in the user's topic\n\n2. **For Trigify-Related Topics**:\n   - First call the Perplexity tool to gather general information about what Trigify does, its features, and typical use cases\n   - Then call the Trigify knowledge hub2 to gather specific information about Trigify's capabilities relevant to the user's topic\n   - Use this gathered information to craft more targeted and effective queries\n\n3. **Maintain Topic Focus**:\n   - Avoid generalizing or substituting terms that alter the user's focus\n   - If the user specifically mentions certain aspects of Trigify (e.g., \"booking meetings\"), keep that exact focus\n\n4. **Generate Queries**:\n   - Create exactly five unique search queries\n   - Each query should include:\n     - The main keywords from the user's input\n     - Minor variations or synonyms that preserve the same narrow focus\n     - For Trigify topics: specific features, methodologies, or use cases discovered from the knowledge tools\n\n5. **Output Format**:\n   - Return the final result as JSON:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"topic\": \"USER_INPUT_TOPIC\",\n     \"searchQueries\": [\n       \"QUERY_1\",\n       \"QUERY_2\",\n       \"QUERY_3\",\n       \"QUERY_4\",\n       \"QUERY_5\"\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. **Respect Research Scope**:\n   - Stay within the user's desired research scope\n   - For non-Trigify topics, avoid adding any reference to Trigify\n   - For Trigify topics, ensure queries are relevant to creating effective lead magnets about Trigify's capabilities\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1 (Trigify-related)\n\n#### UserInput\nBuild a Lead Magnet on how you can use Trigify to book 30+ meetings per week\n\n#### Agent Process\n1. Identifies this is a Trigify-related topic\n2. Calls Perplexity tool to understand Trigify's basic functionality\n3. Calls Trigify knowledge hub2 to gather specific information about meeting booking features\n4.

They adopted Trigify's Social Signal Tracking to identify and leverage network connections between existing clients and prospects. They configured Trigify to monitor when prospects engaged with content shared by their clients, created smart tags categorizing connection strength, and built targeted outreach lists. Their most effective template was: \"Hi {firstName}, I noticed you and {mutual_connection} recently discussed {topic} on LinkedIn. {Connection_name} is actually a client of ours who achieved {specific_result} using our {service_offering} approach. Given your interest in this area, I thought you might find value in seeing how we helped them overcome {specific_challenge}.\" <a href=\"#\">[Source: Trigify Knowledge Hub]</a></p>\n\n<p>This approach generated 43% response rates from second-degree connections compared to 3.7% from cold outreach. ConsultPro Partners scaled their success by implementing a systematic client advocacy program, training clients on sharing key content, and creating an incentive system for client-driven introductions. Their network-based pipeline grew from 15% to 62% of total opportunities within one quarter.</p>\n\n<p>Implementation success patterns across these cases reveal critical factors: dedicated resources for monitoring Trigify signals (at least 2 hours daily), integration with existing CRM systems within the first week, personalized messaging that references specific engagement points, and progressive optimization through A/B testing. Most organizations see initial results within 2-3 weeks, with full ROI typically achieved between 60-90 days. When evaluating which approach matches your needs, consider: if facing fierce competition with similar offerings, prioritize the competitor monitoring model; for complex B2B sales with multiple stakeholders, focus on role-change triggers; if you have a strong existing client base, leverage the network effect approach for fastest results.</p>"

          "output": "<h3>Future-Proofing Your Sales Pipeline</h3>\n\nAs privacy regulations evolve, Trigify positions you ahead of the curve with its approach to ethical signal monitoring. Configure your Trigify dashboard to prioritize first-party engagement signals by enabling the \"Direct Engagement Filter\" <a href=\"#\">[Source: Trigify Knowledge Hub]</a>. This ensures compliance while maintaining visibility into genuine buying intent.\n\nImplementing Trigify's upcoming API (releasing next month) requires three simple steps:\n1. Generate your API key in the Trigify admin panel\n2. Use webhook templates to connect with your existing tech stack\n3. Create conditional workflows in Make.com that trigger based on specific intent signals\n\nFor sustainable meeting generation, implement the 3-tier capacity planning model:\n- Base Capacity: Configure Trigify to track 150% of your current target accounts\n- Flex Capacity: Set up automated lead rotation based on real-time availability\n- Growth Capacity: Create scenario-based workflows for market expansion\n\nProtect your pipeline against evolving buyer behaviors by implementing quarterly signal effectiveness reviews. Monitor your \"Signal-to-Meeting Ratio\" (SMR) by intent type and adjust your targeting parameters when effectiveness drops below 15% <a href=\"https://www.pathfactory.com/blog/intent-signals-vs-buying-signals/\">[Source: PathFactory]</a>.\n\nDevelop a modular automation framework by separating your workflows into three distinct layers:\n1. Signal Collection Layer (Trigify's core functionality)\n2. Enrichment Layer (connecting email and phone data)\n3. Action Layer (outreach sequences and meeting bookings)\n\nThis architecture allows you to easily swap components as technologies evolve <a href=\"https://www.testrail.com/blog/test-automation-framework-design/\">[Source: TestRail]</a>."
